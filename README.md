👋   Hi, I’m Vignesh Nayagam (@vigneshnayagam)

👀   I’m interested in all things Product and Business. I’m currently a Product Manager at BrowserStack, helping build a next-generation test reporting & analytics tool - Test Observability. 

🌱   I'm here to experiment and learn a thing or two about emerging tech and coding.
