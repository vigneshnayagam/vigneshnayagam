ðŸ‘‹   Hi, Iâ€™m Vignesh Nayagam (@vigneshnayagam)

ðŸ‘€   Iâ€™m interested in all things Product and Business. Iâ€™m currently a Product Manager at BrowserStack, helping build a next-generation test reporting & analytics tool - Test Observability. 

ðŸŒ±   I'm here to experiment and learn a thing or two about emerging tech and coding.

âš½   I'm a huge football and FPL fan. I built an ML-powered FPL price change predictor app - [FantasyPriceWatch! Check it out!](https://www.fantasypricewatch.com/?ref=github_profile)
